* helm-google

Emacs Helm Interface for quick web searches.

Currently =helm-google= supports Google and [[https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/][Searx]]

** Screenshot

[[https://raw.github.com/steckerhalter/helm-google/master/screenshot.png]]

** Installation

*** quelpa

=quelpa= is at https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(helm-google :fetcher github :repo "steckerhalter/helm-google"))
#+END_SRC

*** MELPA

=helm-google= is on [[https://melpa.org/][melpa]] (see there for more info).

** Usage

Call it with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x helm-google
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or bind it to a key:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h C--") 'helm-google)
#+END_SRC

If a region is selected it will take that as default input and search Google immediately. Otherwise it will start to search after you have entered a term. Pressing =RET= on a result calls the =browse-url= function which should open the URL in your web browser.

To use the internal =Emacs Web Wowser= (EWW, since Emacs 24.4) to open an url, press @@html:<key>@@F2@@html:</key>@@.

To copy the link into the clipboard, press @@html:<key>@@F3@@html:</key>@@.

If you want use EWW by default you can set it as your default browser like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq browse-url-browser-function 'eww-browse-url)
#+END_SRC

If you want to keep the search open use =C-z= instead of =RET=.

** Customization

The following customizations can also be made via =M-x customize-group RET helm-google RET=.

*** Default search engine

Google is the default engine. To make Searx your default use:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq helm-google-default-engine 'searx)
#+END_SRC

**** Searx infos

I'm using a default Searx instance that does not impose a rate limit. =searx.me= or =searx.info= are not usable because of the rate limitation.

I have limited the engines to =google= because the quality of the other search engines is poor IMO. Sometimes Searx instances fail to get results from Google, so if you don't get results, try another instance from http://stats.searx.oe5tpo.com/, or add more search engines to the url:

: https://searx.dk/?engines=google,bing,yahoo&format=json&q=%s

For additional Searx options see: https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/dev/search_api.html

*** Search parameters

If you want to tweak a search url, you can modify the alist =helm-google-engines=.

*** Idle delay

When you stop typing, a search is launched after an idle time of =0.5s= by default. You can customize this and set it to =1s= for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq helm-google-idle-delay 1)
#+END_SRC

** helm-google-suggest

=helm-google= is added as an action to =helm-google-suggest= (thanks to Dickby). Press TAB and choose =Helm-Google= or use the shortcut listed there directly.
