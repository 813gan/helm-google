* helm-google

Emacs Helm Interface for quick web searches.

Currently =helm-google= supports [[https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/][Searx]], [[https://brave.com/search/][Brave Search]] and [[https://stract.com/beta/api/docs/#/search/widget][Stract]].
Unauthenticated API is used for Searx and Stract.
To use Brave you need to get [[https://brave.com/search/api/][API token]] and set it with

#+BEGIN_src emacs-lisp
(setq helm-google-brave-api-key "YOUR KEY HERE")
#+END_src

** Installation

*** quelpa

=quelpa= is at https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(helm-google :fetcher git :url "https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/helm-google.git"))
#+END_SRC

*** MELPA

=helm-google= is on [[https://melpa.org/][melpa]] (see there for more info).

** Usage

Call it with:

: M-x helm-google

This will use the default search engine ([[https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/][Searx]] is set by default, for customization see below).

To bind it to a key:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h C--") 'helm-google)
#+END_SRC

To use one of the search engines explicitly instead of the default, use the appropriate function:

: M-x helm-google-brave
: M-x helm-google-stract

If a region is selected it will take that as default input and search the web immediately. Otherwise it will start to search after you have entered a term. Pressing =RET= on a result calls the =browse-url= function which should open the URL in your web browser.

*** Actions

You can press =TAB= to view and choose alternative actions or press the appropriate key directly:

| F2 | use the internal =Emacs Web Wowser= (EWW, since Emacs 24.4) to open the url |
| F3 | copy the link into the clipboard                                            |
| F4 | browse the url with the webkit xwidget (if your Emacs supports it)          |

If you want use EWW by default you can set it as your default browser like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq browse-url-browser-function 'eww-browse-url)
#+END_SRC

If you want to keep the search open use =C-z= or =C-j= instead of =RET=.

** Customization

The following customizations can also be made via =M-x customize-group RET helm-google RET=.

*** Default search engine

Searx is the default engine. To make Stract your default use:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq helm-google-default-engine 'stract)
#+END_SRC

**** Searx infos

I'm using a default Searx instance that does not impose a rate limit. =searx.me= or =searx.info= are not usable because of the rate limitation.

I have limited the engines to =google= because the quality of the other search engines is poor IMO. Sometimes Searx instances fail to get results from Google, so if you don't get results, try another instance from http://stats.searx.oe5tpo.com/, or add more search engines to the url:

: https://searx.dk/?engines=google,bing,yahoo&format=json&q=%s

For additional Searx options see: https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/dev/search_api.html

*** Search url and parameters

If you want to tweak a search url, you can modify the alist =helm-google-engines=.

To do it in elisp use =add-to-list=, for example to modify the searx url:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'helm-google-engines '(searx . "https://searx.drakonix.net/?engines=google&format=json&q=%s"))
#+END_SRC

This will /shadow/ the old value which is the correct way to "modify" an alist entry.

*** Idle delay

When you stop typing, a search is launched after an idle time of =0.5s= by default. You can customize this and set it to =1s= for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq helm-google-idle-delay 1)
#+END_SRC

** helm-google-suggest

=helm-google= is added as an action to =helm-google-suggest= (thanks to Dickby). Press TAB and choose =Helm-Google= or use the shortcut listed there directly.
